### Lab Report #3 Acid Rain+

### Introduction and Objectives
We conducted this experiment in order to learn more about acid rain and its resulting acidification of lakes and streams. With acidic water and ANC added to our “lake” we then monitored the pH of the lake and took samples at various times throughout the experiment. We hoped to learn about the influence of ANC over time on a body of water if acid rain were being added to the lake. We expect this experiment to help guide our decisions on appropriate levels of ANC to be added and to better understand the rate at which an ANC supplement is able to neutralize the acidic body of water. We will be able to understand more about ANC through this experiment by using the following derivations:

$ANC_{out} = \left [ ANC_{in}\cdot \left ( 1-e ^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }} \right )\right ]+   ANC_{0}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }}$

Modeling the system as a completely mixed flow reaction, we can determine $C_{T}$ as a function of time:

$C = C_{in}(1-e^{\frac{-t}{\theta }})+C_{0}e^{\frac{-t}{\theta}}$

For a conservative species $C_{T}$ becomes:

$C_{T}=C_{T_{0}}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\theta}}$

There are many different ways to calculate the ANC when modeling the lake using different methods. Assuming that the lake can be modeled as a completely mixed flow reactor, we calculate the "conservative ANC" using the following derivation.

Equation 1.21 gives: $ANC_{out} = \left [ ANC_{in}\cdot \left ( 1-e ^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }} \right )\right ]+   ANC_{0}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }}$

$C_{T}=C_{T_{0}}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\theta}}$
However, if we were to assume that no carbonates are exchanged with the atmosphere throughout the experiment, we would describe ANC as that of a closed system and calculate it using the following equation (1.13):
$ANC = C_{T} * (alpha_{1} + 2alpha_{2}) + \frac{K_{w}}{\left [ H^{+} \right ]}-\left [ H^{+} \right ]$
In order to get a full understanding of ANC in different conditions, we can also calculate the "open ANC" under the assumption that carbonates are at equilibrium with the atmosphere using the following equation (1.15):
  $ANC = \frac{P_{CO_{2}}K_{H}}{a_{0}} * (alpha_{1} + 2alpha_{2}) + \frac{K_{w}}{\left [ H^{+} \right ]}-\left [ H^{+} \right ]$


### Procedure

For the first trial of this experiment we followed the instructions as given in the CEE 4530 Spring 2018 lab Manual and used a tube size of 17. For the second trial of the experiment we continuously monitored pH using a calibrated pH probe. We pumped in acid rain while draining out lake water at a constant flow rate and using a tube size of 17. We added bromocresol green to the lake and added of NaHCO3  while continuously stirring. Lake water samples were taken every 5 minutes from time zero minutes to 20 minutes. Finally we measured the effluent flow rate. We deviated from the lab manual and did not ground our equipment, which allowed electricity to flow through the lake throughout the second trail.

### Discussion

In order to get a full understanding of ANC in different conditions, as a completely mixed flow reactor, as a closed system, as well as an open system.

In modeling the system as a completely mixed flow reactor, we can determine ANC using the following equation (1.21) to determine the "conservative ANC", see figure 2 from the results section:
$ANC_{out} = \left [ ANC_{in}\cdot \left ( 1-e ^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }} \right )\right ]+   ANC_{0}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\Theta }}$



Alternatively, if we were to assume that no carbonates are exchanged with the atmosphere throughout the experiment, we would describe ANC as that of a closed system and calculate it using the following equation (1.13), see figure 3 from the results section:
$ANC = C_{T} * (alpha_{1} + 2alpha_{2}) + \frac{K_{w}}{\left [ H^{+} \right ]}-\left [ H^{+} \right ]$


Finally, we can also calculate the "open ANC" under the assumption that carbonates are at equilibrium with the atmosphere using the following equation (1.15), see figure 4 from the results section:
  $ANC = \frac{P_{CO_{2}}K_{H}}{a_{0}} * (alpha_{1} + 2alpha_{2}) + \frac{K_{w}}{\left [ H^{+} \right ]}-\left [ H^{+} \right ]$

The differences amongst these plot demonstrate that


### Conclusions
The conclusions section should not include any new observation. It is the place to summarize the results in a few sentences. Make sure you connect your conclusions to your objectives for doing the research.

The pH probe turned out to be very sensitive since it is really measuring voltage and not pH. In our second experiment we did not ground the apparatus and our graph reflects that. Although the general shape of a titration curve is evident there are many fluctuations.

#### Suggestions and Comments

The data acquisition software inserts comments directly into the data files and makes it difficult to extract data during analysis. However, using the code Monroe shared with the class this problem has been addressed. The magnetic stirrer has a short cord and getting the pH probe to stretch from the computer to the lake was tricky. The setup of the lake proved to have some issues as water leaked out of the pipe before reaching the beaker as we measured flow rate. Additionally since the sinks drain on opposite sides of the bench and are shallow and small it was difficult to measure the effluent flow rate by measuring the exit volume of “lake water” over a short period of time. The experiment could be easier to understand if there were more discussion regarding the trend that we will likely to see from our ProCoda data. By failing to ground our experiment in one of the trials, it took our group a bit to recognize that there was an error in the ProCoda data that we were collecting. I believe having more data sharing from Trail 1 between groups would provide valuable insight into ANC properties since each group does not have time to do every experiment. Another way to analyze the data would be using the Gran plot which involves a titration where the equivalence volume is estimated based on pH and titrant volume. Overall the lab did provide valuable insight into managing acid rain lake remediation and the difference between theoretical and experimental methods.
