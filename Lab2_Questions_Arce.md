2. Create a graph of absorbance at 660 nm vs. concentration of methylene blue in Atom using the exported data file. Does absorbance at 660 nm increase linearly with concentration of methylene blue?



```python
from aide_design.play import *

help(np.array)
concentration = np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5]*u.mg/u.L)
absorbance660 = np.array([.0005,0.2216,0.3686,0.5812,0.7560,0.9999])

plt.plot(concentration,absorbance660)
plt.ylabel('Absorbance')
plt.xlabel('Concentration Methylene Blue (mg/L)')
plt.show()
```
3. 3)	Plot epsilon as a function of wavelength for each of the standards on a single graph. Note that the path length is 1 cm. Make sure you include units and axis labels on your graph. If Beerâ€™s law is obeyed what should the graph look like?

```python

File = r'C:\Users\Anthony\github\CEE4530_axa2\CEE4530_Lab1data_ohe3.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(File)
info = np.array(data)

lines = plt.plot(info[:,0], info[:,1:7])
plt.xlabel('Wavelengh (nm)')
plt.ylabel('Absorbance')
plt.legend(('0 mg/L', '1 mg/L', '2 mg/L', '3 mg/L', '4 mg/L', '5 mg/L'), loc ='upper right')
plt.show()

```

# If Beer's law is obeyed, then the graph should look like scalar multiples of the same curve.

4. Did you use interpolation or extrapolation to get the concentration of the unknown?

Used interpolation to get the concentration of the unknown. The unknown was within the values of the standards, if it had been beyond, then it would be extrapolation.

5. What colors of light are most strongly absorbed by methylene blue?

The colors that methylene blue absorb strongly correspond to 290 nm and 660 nm,
ultraviolet and and red-orange color.

6. What measurement controls the accuracy of the density measurement for the NaCl solution? What density did you expect (see prelab 2)? Approximately what should the accuracy be? 	

The measurement that controls the accuracy of the density measurement for the NaCl solution is the pipette. The accuracy should be within +/- one percent! The density should be
