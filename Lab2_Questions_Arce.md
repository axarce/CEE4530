2. Create a graph of absorbance at 660 nm vs. concentration of methylene blue in Atom using the exported data file. Does absorbance at 660 nm increase linearly with concentration of methylene blue?

3. 3)	Plot epsilon as a function of wavelength for each of the standards on a single graph. Note that the path length is 1 cm. Make sure you include units and axis labels on your graph. If Beerâ€™s law is obeyed what should the graph look like?

```python
from aide_design.play import *

concentration =
absorbance

```
